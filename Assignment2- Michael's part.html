Name: Michael Formosa
<br>
Student Number: s3544418
<br>
Background: Australian
<br>
Hobbies: Video Games and hanging out with my friends
<br>
IT interest: I have a strong interest in building computers and new technology. This varies from software technology to new computer hardware.
<br>
IT experience: I have little to no IT experience, outside of building 2 computer systems for myself.
<br>
<br>
Personality Tests:
I was placed in the ‘Adventurer’ category after completing the Meyers-Briggs test. This personality group identified myself as being a design orientated individual with good attention to detail. I believe that this will help the team as my personality should enable myself to provide creative alternative perspectives to discussion. Naturally being quite a reserve and quiet individual, I believe that I will initially listen to the opinions of others in my team before setting forth my ideas. The Big Five Personality test reinforces this as I scored quite high (60%) in the category of agreeableness. My personality will likely lead to myself seeking out the collaboration of others in my team, rather than push forth only my own ideas. Being quite a tactile learner as shown by the learning styles test, will likely encourage myself to attempt to push a hands-on approach to the planning process. During discussion surrounding the project, I may look to introduce a brainstorming diagram to cater for those who are visual, tactile and auditory.
<br>

Ideal Job 
My ideal job is to work as a software engineer which will allow myself to write, debug, maintain, and test software. This role aligns with my personality, as it enables myself to explore design orientated mindset in a hands-on role. Some of my team members would also like to pursue a career in software engineering. This is not all that surprising considering that there were a staggering 4,000 Software Engineer positions available between August 2018-August 2019 (Burning Glass Technologies, 2020).  However, others have desired to obtain a position within cyber security and data analytics. These positions differ to those of a software engineer as the analyst role typically revolves around the observation/examination of data/security measures to make business decisions.

Augmented reality (AR) by definition is an “enhanced version of reality created by the use of technology to overlay digital information on an image of something being viewed through a device” (Merriam-Webster, 2020). The idea of augmented reality enables creators to alter the experience of users through the use of digital information that is layered upon the images seen by users (Thinkmobiles, 2020). In practice, augmented reality is seen through applications such as Snapchat, in which the application makes you appear as things such as a dog.

There are two types of augmented reality, with both versions presenting differing experiences. 
Marker AR:
The first version of augmented reality is coded to begin when a camera or device is pointed toward a pre-programmed marker image. For example, if you were to point your mobile towards a wall, you would see a virtual image of the McDonald’s logo.
Markerless AR: 
Conversely, Markerless AR functions in a different manner. This version of augmented reality is launched upon the instance in which the program is run without the need of a marker to initiate it (Medium, 2020). Markerless AR is seen through applications such as 3D kitchen designers. 

Currently, augmented reality is used in places of education; both in schools and medical environments. AR has been utilised in education spaces as a visual tool to assist with discussion. The visual perspective that AR provides, enables educators to direct student’s attention to intricate details, in addition to providing a more captivating learning experience.
Additionally, augmented reality has recently become heavily relied upon in the design space. Many design applications such as ‘IKEA Place’ allow users to plan their room layout using an interactive AR application. These applications have altered the design cycle to become more user inclusive rather than purely to the device of designers.
Furthermore, popular social media and photography applications like Instagram and Facebook make use of augmented reality to make alterations to user’s photos and videos. These applications give access for users to impose filters on their images to augment themselves into things such as a tiger.


In the next 3 years it is possible that the following will become available in augmented reality:
<li> AR Advertising – As people are looking to purchase a greater number of AR glasses and headsets, the advertising platforms available to businesses expands. Major companies will be likely looking for new and innovative ways to promote their businesses. As the AR space evolves, advertisements will become more common </li>
(Datafloq, 2020).
<li> Changes to Navigation and geo-based experiences – As the capability of AR applications increases, it appears that navigation applications such as ‘Google Maps’ may look to incorporate AR functionality to improve the user experience. This experience will likely be adapted to incorporate indoor navigation through places like shopping centres, large building complexes and airports (Medium, 2020).</li>

The recent developments of 5G technology has enabled significant developments in the world of augmented reality. The significant increases in data transfer speeds has enabled AR to be streamed direct from cloud-based servers (Marr, 2020). This would likely lead to an advancement in application capability and an improvement in device energy efficiency. 

The likely impact of improved AR is that the world becomes more digitally connected, as workforces become greater equip to complete tasks through improved effectiveness and efficiency. 
Examples of improved functionality can be seen in the automotive industry, as car makers have historically modelled new car designs using clay. Car designs can be created digitally which enables car designers to create a visual model of the interior of the car. This enables car makers the ability to see another perspective of their design.
The people who are most likely to be affected by the changes to augmented reality are students and teachers, consumers such as typical retailers and businesses through additional advertising and efficiency improvements.
Augmented reality will likely create, replace and make current positions redundant, as the way that people are expected to interact with their jobs is expected to change. According to the 2017 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends report, “almost every job will be reinvented for what many are calling the augmented workforce” (Employment Hero, 2020). 
In the retail space for example, the customer shopping experience will change to a more digital landscape. This will create jobs for technicians and support teams to create applications and assist with issues that arise over time (Council, 2020).


As augmented reality becomes increasingly utilised in my life, I believe that the way in which I interact with technology will change. As products like augmented reality glasses become more mainstream, the need for certain devices such as smart watches or mobile phone may reduce. I may find myself using AR specific technology such as ‘Google Glass’ to navigate my way through streets rather than using my phone or watch. 

My personal perspective of my surroundings will differ to those around me as AR becomes more prevalent in society. Boo Wong has even suggested that we will “no longer have a common experience of our shared environment” as we will all experience a different reality. The way in which we interact with each other will likely change, as the way in which we interpret situations may differ completely from others in the same physical space. Recent testing has shown that when given the opportunity to acknowledge the existence of augmented reality, all people tested chose to sit on the empty chair beside the artificial avatar created by AR rather than sit on the same chair it was occupying (World Economic Forum, 2020). The study highlights that augmented reality technology changes the way in which people react to digitally constructed beings/objects.

It is likely that social interaction with friends and families will be affected, as individuals become entranced in their own experiences of the AR world. An experience is what bonds friends and family, and what encourages closeness amongst individuals (Handel, 2020). As these experiences become unique, individuals may find that they lack that shared commonality that drives strong relationships.
