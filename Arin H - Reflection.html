<p> During Assignment 2, Our group was established quickly since most of us had the similar interests and ideal jobs. We named ourselves 1080p. At our group meeting, we immediately began discussing who is doing which part of the assignment and we all came to a consensus rather quickly. Each group member was dedicated to the work required for the assignment as a whole as well as each meeting, if a group member was unable to attend a particular meeting they would inform the rest of the team which I felt was great as it enhanced our communication towards one another. All the elements of the assignment were handled efficiently, and I am proud to be part of this team. One thing I would improve would be the timeliness of our responses from the Microsoft Teams chat since it often took a while to get an answer from group members. One surprising thing would have been the way our team got along even though we have not met each other in person but everyone was chill and cool to chat with. I learnt that a group requires A LOT of teamwork and dedication to ensure our project is completed on time but also to a high standard.   </p>
